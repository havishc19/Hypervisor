To compile:
1. open terminal
2. run command "make"

To run:
1. create and start virtual machines.
2. run jobs on virtual machines. (For example, the 3 testcases)
3. open terminal
4. run command "./Memory_coordinator <period(s)>"
5. see the console output. 

Note: 
1. The logs for testcase 2 and testcase 3 were made with maxmemory of vms being set to 800MB. The reason is that my computer has a limited amount of memory reserved for vm. Thus all vms taking more than 900MB may result in one vm crashing.
2. For best result, please restart all vms before going to the next testcase.
